# name = "data - The first mistake is that variable "name" was defined with string type meaning information "data" which needed to be in quantities to store text message in variable but at last it missed one quantity which not creates any variable because text information isnt converted with quantities and isnt fully stored for it's type at this situation string.
name = "data" 
# surname = "diasamidze - The second mistake is that when creating variables we use to name that variable a text based on the information it requires so its more acceptable to name the variable relevantly on it's stored data so "surname" should be changed with "username" and last mistake here is that inside this variable stored text message string type information isnt fully converted with quantities which make it not belongs to string type data and information storing category so because of the inside variable "username" stored text message information "diasamidze" isnt converted between on both sides quantities its mistake so its missing quantity at the end.
username = "diasamidze"
age = 17
# print("My name is" + " " + name + "my surname is" + " " + surname + "my age is" + age") - The third mistake is in printing where we put wrong variables which contains uncompleted data included information variables because on each variable the stored text message string type data information isnt converted with quantities which make them not belongs to information forming category data type which uncompletes those variables of what kind of information are they storing and what should computer read when naming them and it makes variable become empty with inside storing data type included text message string type data information. and also when when we are facing different type of variable's inside data information forming category we cant concatenate them. and lastly we need to add up with string type text message formed information a spaces between every formed word or on every step when we expressing some kind of information or data with different data type information types and to make different type of variable's included data type changing information, them concatenate. in that situation when we need to add up different kind of variable stored data information types we use f strings with letter "f" at the begining of the string quantity then loading inside the f string text message data information type variables with "{}" signs to concatenate inside text message data information string type texted information a different data information type compared to texted data information type category included mathematical or floated number operation data information type data informations.


print(f"My name is {name}" + " " + "my username is" + " " + username + f"My age is {age}" + " years.")


#2)
add = 1
add = add + 1 
print(add) # in the terminal we will see that the last converted information in add will be raised by 1 because the lastly changed variable was requiring it's stored integer information raised by 1
#3) The reassign is operation when the variables are having same name which contains different data informations but the main variable's included data type, readable for computer, information will be the same variable's lastly wrote name's included data information, on which has been implemented very lastly the operations, on the same named variable's inside information and which is changed and wrote very lastly with some kind of operations and will be defaulted the one to make the computer read inside it's stored data or text message information with the same named variable which is very lastly defined with different or same by changing information with operations, data and to make data type information read by the computer defined to the same named variable to the lastly wrote data type information included same named variable and to make inside same named variable data type information types, data informations and text message information differentiate from eachother it is choosing ver lastly updated and wrote variable data type information inside variable stored data texted message category type data information define of which should to choose when making operations and mathmatical equations on same named data type on very lastly line wrote and updated variable included lastly changed data information and informations forming data type to define from the same named variables the lastly named variable's included data type information from other ones and to use it when calling variable to use it's data type information to make operations and mathematical equations.

#4)Discount task
balance = 200
discount = 0.45
Last_price = 200 - balance * discount
print(f"The last price based on your balance will be {Last_price}")
